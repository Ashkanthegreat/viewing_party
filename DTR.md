# DTR: Define the Relationship for paired project - Viewing Party with Ash & Dan

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  * Ash - better understanding of APIs and a refresher of Mod 1 skills (Ruby)
  * Dan - better understanding of Oauth, APIs, JSON
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * Ash - Driver/navigator, also do things on own to try and figure them out
  * Dan - Pair is OK, divide / conquer also is OK
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  * Ash - Any sort of communication - slack/zoom
  * Dan - More communication is better than less, slack/zoom also OK
* How would you describe your work style?
  * Ash - Easy going, tackle one problem at a time
  * Dan - Trying to get better at planning for future issues, but generally take things one at a time
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  * Ash - Team work, Google, general problem solving skills
  * Dan - Open to trying new approaches to solve a problem, asking for help
  * These skills can complement each other by not getting stuck on certain issues for too long. Also by getting into a 'productive struggle' mindset
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  * Ash - Poorly: one group member was changing the others' code without telling them. Well: Good communication is key
  * Dan - Poorly: lack of communication, one person took over the project and their voice was heard over everyone else's. Well: Programming style and personalities were similar
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  * Ash - If there is a disagreement, work through it to try and see what is the easiest/best solution
  * Dan - We can communicate via slack and/or zoom to see how we want to tackle a particular problem
* How will we overcome obstacles?
  * Ash - Communication is key, also be able to ask for help
  * Dan - Communication is key
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  * Ash - Have it now - a good environment/desk setup
  * Dan - Quiet space to work
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * Ash - Not in particular except Tuesday nights 7 PM mentor meeting
  * Dan - Thursday at 5 PM mentor meeting
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  * Ash - Honest, constructive, actionable
  * Dan - Constructive, actionable, kind
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  * Ash -
  * Dan - Rails topics I'm OK on. I could improve on Ruby specific topics.
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  * GitHub projects, conveyer belt, Heroku
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  * Communicate and try to figure out what to do as a group
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  * We've learned something and get a 3 on every topic in the rubric.
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
  * As long as we learned something, that is a celebration.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
  * Ash - Vide off to focus on the task at hand
  * Dan - Video on or off, little background noise
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.)
  * Ash - Dog who can sometimes have issues
  * Dan - NA
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
  * Ash - Sit outside a Starbucks for Wifi, cell phone hot spot
  * Dan - Go to Turing building if all else fails, cell phone hot spot
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
  * 5-10 minute breaks every 25-45 mins
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
  * Be open to communicate via slack/zoom if anything comes up
